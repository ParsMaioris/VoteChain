# VoteChain App

Welcome to the VoteChain app - a new and evolving [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project focused on creating a secure and user-driven referendum platform using blockchain technology. This project is bootstrapped with [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## ðŸŒŸ Join Our Development Journey

We are in the early stages of building VoteChain and invite developers, designers, and blockchain enthusiasts to contribute to this exciting project. Your insights, code contributions, and feedback are invaluable to us. Together, let's shape the future of decentralized voting!

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you've completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Begin by starting **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ included with React Native.

Run this command from your project's root directory:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start the Application

Keep Metro Bundler running. Open a _new_ terminal at your project's root and execute the command to launch your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

The app should appear on your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ if everything is set up correctly.

### Step 3: Modifying the App

Now, try modifying the app:

1. Edit `App.tsx` in your preferred text editor.
2. To see changes:
   - **Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or use the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>).
   - **iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.
